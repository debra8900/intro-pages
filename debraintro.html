  <h2> Hey Everyone! My name is Debra, and I am a Senior here at Pace! I am a part of the Seidenberg School, as well as the Pforzheimer Honors College. 
    I will be graduating with my Bachelor of Science Degree this May in Information Systems, with a minor in Graphic Design. As a student, I have interned at 
    various companies including Mount Sinai Health System, 1-800-Flowers.com Inc., and BNY Mellon over the past few years. </h2>

    <h2> I am from Levittown, NY on Long Island, and I commute to the Pace Campus in New York City. Some of my favorite things to do include listening to music and podcasts,
      and watching movies. I also like to design, whether that is through UI/UX or digital drawings, for my own personal projects. I also like taking photos and
      travelling in my free time.
    </h2>

    <h2>After I graduate, I will be pursuing a full-time position with JP Morgan Chase and Co. in New York City, as a Software Engineer in their Software Engineering (Tech Connect) Program. 
    I will also be pursuing my masters degree at New York University in Management of Technology, part-time beginning this fall. 
    My goals are to help others through my passions for technology and business, and becoming a Product Manager or a UX Designer in the near-future. In this class, I
  look forward to learning more about web development and applying that to my career as a technologist, no matter what position that may be in.</h2>
